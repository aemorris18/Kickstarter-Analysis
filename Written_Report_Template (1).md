Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Goals

Overview
This analysis of outcomes based on Launch dates and Goal provides useful information on plays success, failure and cancellations as they relate to launch dates and Kickstarter goals.
Purpose
The analysis will illuminate the succession, failure or cancelation on a range of specified goal ranges and launch dates. 
Analysis and Challenges
There was a total of 1,043 projects. Out of the 1,043 projects, 694 and were successful, 349 were failed, and there were zero cancellations. The most successful project ranges were $40,000 to 49,999 with 2 projects with a 100% goal rate. The least successful range were the 2 projects in the $50,000 and greater range with a 12.50% goal rate. Most of the projects fell within the $1000 to $4999 range with a total of 534 projects with 388 of them with a success rate of 72.66% 
When it comes to the successes, failures and cancelations based on launch dates the most successful months were May with a total of 234 plays, followed by June with 211 plays and February with 202 plays. The least successful months were December with 111 successful plays followed by September with 147, and August with 166 plays.
Results
We can surmise two conclusions from the data provided for outcomes based on launch dates which are that Kickstarter’s for plays are most successful in February, May and June and that ones in December are least successful. This may be due to in part by the Christmas Holidays as would be donors are distracted with the events and monetarily divided by the Holidays.
For Outcomes Based on Goals the most successful are the smaller funded projects with the majority of success in the $0 to $4999 range. Bigger production budgets run a higher risk of failure and should not begin in the months listed as high rates of failure.
We have limited data and we have no data on how the Kickstarter’s are initiated and handled from start to finish, which would provide better data analysis if we had the data from those kickstarters. We lack information data on advertising these kickstarters which would illuminate the issue as well.
We could have done a length of time between announcement and launch dates and graph the information to see how long it takes to meet or exceed the goals for the kickstarters. This information may also allude to timeframe issues when collecting monies.
